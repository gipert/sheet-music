Music *without attributes*, or *serious*<sup><a href="#fn1"
id="ref1">1</a></sup>, in its endless tension towards research and
experimentation, keeps evolving and unveiling hidden details anytime we listen
to it. The feelings that it evokes and the atmosphere it creates around us let
us reflect on ourselves and the context we isolate from through a stereo
system or a pair of headphones—admit it, even a concert hall is a good place
for our loneliness.  This kind of music, if we stick to the definition I just
proposed, hardly obeys the rules of the music industry. Paolo Castaldi,
interviewed by Luciano Berio during an episode of the Italian TV series *C’è
musica & musica*, broadcasted by the RAI during the seventies, declared:

> [...] la prima [la musica “senza aggettivi”] bisognerebbe che fosse discussa
> come fatto sociologico, piuttosto che come fatto musicale. A parere di molti,
> e un po’ anche mio, essa non è veramente musica perchè, per definizione,
> musica è quella che è fatta secondo i gusti di chi la compone, mentre invece
> la musica commerciale non è fatta secondo i gusti di chi la compone ma
> secondo i gusti di chi la deve consumare, cosa che è in conflitto con il
> concetto stesso di composizione.

> [...] [music "without attributes"] should be discussed as a sociological
> fact, rather than a musical fact. Many people, partly including myself,
> believe that this kind of music cannot be really defined as music because, by
> definition, music is something which is made according to the composer’s
> taste, while the mainstream music is made according to the consumer’s taste,
> and this contradicts the meaning of composition itself.

By the way, exceptions are not that rare.

I found, during my adolescence, what I was looking for in the old-school
progressive rock, deliberately (sometimes exaggeratedly) virtuosic but
extremely descriptive and rich music genre—someone would call it *landscape
music*.  During the following years I gradually left this world because of a
physiological need of renovation, and, considering the disappointing prog-rock
state-of-arts, I entered the land of jazz music, modern classical (no joke,
people actually use this name), ambient and electronic music.

When a song strikes me from the harmonic, melodic, rhythmic and timbral point
of view (let's just say that I like it a lot) I try to transcribe it in the
most complete way I can. When I’m done, after some rewarding minutes of
self-satisfaction, I realise that I don’t wanna my work to stay hidden from the
rest of the world in a computer folder, it should be available to anyone
interested and equipped with an internet connection! This is the purpose of
this blog, where you can find my transcription (in PDF format) along with some
supplementary information.

Last but not least: I chose [Gumroad](http://www.gumroad.com) as the download
platform and set a symbolic 1 Euro price for each transcription. This is
because, frankly, after I've spent countless hours on a project, I’m not very
happy with an indiscriminate diffusion of the material on the web. Gumroad
allows to give an arbitrarily higher amount of money, if someone want to more
effectively show his appreciation...

Obviously, any comment, critic or suggestion is very welcome. Did you spot a
typo in the scores? Do you have some transcription proposal or commission?
Contact me, and I'll be happy to discuss about it.

        <em>res severa est verum gaudium</em>, wrote Seneca. Some people,
        later, wanted to remind it to the audience of the <em>Gewandhaus</em>,
