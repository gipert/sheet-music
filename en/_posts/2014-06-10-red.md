Finally some King Crimson! Some days ago I was at a concert by the Crimson
Projekct and *Red* was definitely one of the best songs of all the evening, so
that I came back home later with a impelling need of transcribing it. The
piece, a composition by Robert Fripp, appears to the world in the homonymous
1974 album but actually anticipates a lot of the style that the King Crimson
adopted from the eighties on (the Adrian Belew years, to be clear). Not by
chance it has been widely recycled and re-edited during the years.

The song is rather clear from the point of view of the instrumentation (two
guitars, electric bass and drums), a little bit less from the point of view of
the musical structure, but this is Robert Fripp folks! You'll find the full
score except for the drums, as usual.
