Nils Frahm is one of the contemporary neoclassical composers that, just like
many Nordic colleagues (see Ã“lafur Arnalds), finds his personal compromise
between the European music tradition and the modern needs with a careful
timbral research based on a combination of electronics (strictly analog) and
acoustic (often prepared *ad-hoc*) instrument. The outcome is extremely
introspective and breathtaking, minimalistic in its harmonic architecture, just
to let the listener focus on the atmosphere rather than the score itself.

*Hammers* is a piano solo piece found in *Spaces*, a 2013 album, based on a
harsh *ostinato* that exploits the harmonic progression with minimum
variations.  Philip Glass? Steve Reich? Probably.
