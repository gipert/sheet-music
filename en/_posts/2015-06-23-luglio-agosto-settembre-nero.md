First track of Area's *Arbeit Macht Frei*, from which I already transcribed
[something]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link en/_posts/2014-05-07-arbeit-macht-frei.md
%}) in the past. Even more politically engaged in its direct reference to what
happened in September 1972 during the MÃ¼nchen Olympic Games. The track
structure is a perfect example of the compositional style adopted during the
[Cramps records](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramps_Records) days: musicians
elaborated their ideas privately to incorporate them afterwards into the final
performance. Area's compositions from the period contain many different musical
ideas that could individually had given birth to separate tracks, but that were
mixed into a single entity, like in a post-production editing effort.

As always, many Balkan music reminiscences in melodies and rhythm, clearly
traceable in Fariselli's main theme.
