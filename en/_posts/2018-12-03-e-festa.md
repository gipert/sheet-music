Here's the other find from the past, a transcription, arranged for piano and
guitar, of the Premiata Forneria Marconi *divertissement*: *È Festa*. This time
the project had a serious motivation, the track was part of my band's lineup!

You'll notice that the piano part is in fact a *collage* of the many keyboards
moments of the track, while the guitar part is, more or less, a quite faithful
transcription. Recommended for people that want to have fun!
