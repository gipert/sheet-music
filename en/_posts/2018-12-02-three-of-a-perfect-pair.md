Here I am, after a while, with a brand new (bilingual!) website and new scores
(let's see how much does it last...). While cleaning up the computer folder
with all my projects, finished or not, I found something from the past that is
worth to upload here.

At a certain point in the past I wanted to trascribe Tony Levin's bass part in
King Crimson's *Three of a Perfect Pair*, to be able to play it on my just-bought
bass guitar. Enjoy.
