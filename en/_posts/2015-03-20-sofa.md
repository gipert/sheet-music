Appearing in 1975 in *One Size Fits All*, the nineteenth Frank Zappa's album
with Mothers of Invention, *Sofa* is produced in two versions, an instrumental
one (*No. 1*) and a second one (*No. 2*) with English and German lyrics. The
track is a passionate ode to man's best friend (yes, the sofa), sung by his
owner.

> *Ich bin der dreck unter deinen walzen*<br/>
> *Ich bin dein geheimer schmutz*<br/>
> *Und verlorenes metallgeld*<br/>
>
> I am the filth under your rollers<br/>
> I am the secret dirt<br/>
> And the lost coins<br/>

A special mention to Tom Fowler's fretless bass guitar, it just gives the
perfect ambience.
